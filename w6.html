    <h1>Security Features of Blockchain Technology</h1>
    <p>
        Introduction<br><br>
        Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we handle transactions and data. Its inherent security
        features play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information. In this article,
        we will explore the key security features of blockchain technology and how they contribute to a more secure
        digital environment.<br><br>
        1. **Decentralization**<br>
        One of the foundational security features of blockchain is its decentralized nature. Traditional centralized
        systems are vulnerable to single points of failure and are more susceptible to hacking attempts. In a
        blockchain network, data is distributed across a network of nodes, making it significantly more resilient to
        attacks.<br><br>
        2. **Cryptography**<br>
        Blockchain relies on cryptographic techniques to secure the data within each block. Each transaction is
        encrypted and linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks. This ensures the integrity of the data,
        as altering one block would require changing the entire chain, which is computationally infeasible.<br><br>
        3. **Immutable Ledger**<br>
        Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This immutability is a
        critical security feature, as it provides a tamper-proof record of all transactions. It makes blockchain
        particularly valuable for applications where audit trails and transparency are essential.<br><br>
        4. **Consensus Mechanisms**<br>
        Blockchain networks employ consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and ensure agreement among nodes.
        Popular consensus algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). These mechanisms add an
        additional layer of security by requiring nodes to agree on the validity of a transaction before it is added
        to the ledger.<br><br>
        5. **Permissioned Access**<br>
        Some blockchains implement permissioned access, meaning that only authorized parties can participate in the
        network. This is particularly important for enterprise applications where privacy and data control are
        paramount. Permissioned blockchains strike a balance between the transparency of a public blockchain and the
        controlled access of a private one.<br><br>
        6. **Smart Contracts**<br>
        Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically
        execute
