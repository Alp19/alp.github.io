    <h1>What is Free Software and Open Source?</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
        Free Software and Open Source are two closely related concepts that have had a significant impact on the world of
        technology and software development. While they share common values, they differ in their philosophical
        approach and the licenses they use. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental principles of Free Software
        and Open Source, their history, and their implications in today's digital landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Free Software</strong><br>
        Free Software refers to software that provides users with the freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute the
        software and its source code. This freedom is essential as it empowers users to have control over the software
        they use. The Free Software movement, pioneered by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, emphasizes
        the ethical and social aspects of software freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Key Characteristics of Free Software:</strong><br>
        - Freedom to Use: Users have the freedom to run the program for any purpose.<br>
        - Freedom to Study: Users can access and examine the source code to understand how the program works.<br>
        - Freedom to Modify: Users can make changes to the source code to suit their needs or fix issues.<br>
        - Freedom to Distribute: Users can share the software and their modifications with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Open Source</strong><br>
        Open Source software is developed collaboratively, with its source code made available to the public. Unlike Free
        Software, Open Source focuses on the practical benefits of collaborative development, such as increased
        security, reliability, and innovation. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a prominent organization that promotes
        and certifies Open Source licenses.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Key Characteristics of Open Source:</strong><br>
        - Collaborative Development: Projects are often developed by a community of contributors from around the world.<br>
        - Transparency: The source code is accessible to all, allowing for scrutiny and verification.<br>
        - Reliability and Security: Many eyes on the code lead to faster bug identification and resolution.<br>
        - Innovation: Open Source fosters a culture of innovation through shared knowledge and resources.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Common Ground</strong><br>
        While Free Software and Open Source have distinct origins and philosophies, they share a common goal of promoting
        software freedom and collaboration. Many projects and licenses fall under both categories, embodying the
        principles of both Free Software and Open Source.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        Free Software and Open Source have significantly influenced the software industry, leading to the development of
        some of the most widely used and innovative technologies today. Whether driven by ethical considerations or
        practical benefits, the principles of Free Software and Open Source continue to shape the digital landscape and
        empower users worldwide.
